evolution of pathogen communities

not very organized at the moment

- `nn1.*`: primary writeup/outline
- `nn2_funs.R`: primary code file
- `nn2_sims.R`: basic sims with mutating beta (N=1000,100,33) (output in `nn_runs_1.rda` (!))
- `nn3_sims.R`: Latin hypercube sims (`nn_runs_3.rda`)
- `nn4_sims.R`: like `nn2`, but with mutating gamma (`nn_runs_4.rda`)
- `nn5_sims.R`: like `nn3`, but with mutating gamma (`nn_runs_5.rda`)
- `nn6_sims.R`: like `nn3`, but with continuously distributed gamma
- `nn7_sims.R`: like `nn5`, but with gamma constrained to (0.1,0.5)
