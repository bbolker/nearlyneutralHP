Mathematical models of parasite evolution most often use a
deterministic framework, where the only role of stochasticity is to
provide raw material for adaptation via mutation. In an attempt to
consider the diversity of parasite virulence from a broad perspective,
and in particular to understand the broad range of virulence and the
large number of low-virulence parasites found in natural communities,
we explore a range of stochastic, discrete-population models. Our
models incorporate mutation, drift, and selection; each distinct
parasite strain differs in transmission, host clearance
rate/virulence, or both.  In the absence of a virulence-transmission
tradeoff, we find as expected that parasites are strongly selected for
increased transmission and decreased virulence, limited only by the
effects of mutation and drift; smaller host populations have
lower-transmission/lower-virulence parasites. We also observe a
bimodal distribution of outcomes depending on the mean and standard
deviation of the mutational spectrum.
