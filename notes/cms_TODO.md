- various sanity-check runs:
   - discrete vs continuous
   - discrete with reduced step size
   - C++??
   - different link functions
   - constraints
   - how small a pop size do we need to get saturating beta/gamma/R0 without constraints?
   - **tradeoff curves**

- stuff to talk about
   - drift, in general
   - ways to model (diffusion equations, diffusion with scaled drift, absorbing boundaries, quasi-equilibrium distributions)
   - discrete vs continuous genotypes/phenotypes?
   - effective population sizes, bottlenecks (Bergstrom, Elena et al)
