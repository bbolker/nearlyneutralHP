- bimodality: transient effect?
- track lineage age
- SIRS
- output distributions
- alternate mutational models
- profile
- Rcpp version
- tradeoff (how implemented?)
- cf. adaptiveTau, GillespieSSA
- diffusion equation version??
  (cf Birch code)
  approximation near eco-evo equilibrium?
    (variance effects on prop inf small?)
  diffusion equation with sqrt-N scaling?
- narrative: bottleneck effects (e.g. Bergstrom, McElhany, Real)
- boom/bust peak/trough; effective pop size may be small
